It's all about proximity. It's life at the centre of it all. It's taking advantage of the numerous transit options and easily getting from point A to point B. Or it's staying home and availing yourself of the reimagined retail and entertainment of Toronto's newest place to be – Yonge and Eglinton. At eCentral the world is at your doorstep. It's why your living room looks better and why your weekends sound better. It's why you seize every opportunity, because you can, and because the day won't live itself.
